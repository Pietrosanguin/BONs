## Import and preprocessing of Newspaper Articles XML Repository

For a NDA I cannot share the xml files. However here there is the import and preprocessing management of the files in order to continue the research. 
In particular the data requested for the work are two datasets of all the Italian news articles concerning politics from December 2017 to April 2018, which is also denoted as p1 and from June 2022 to October 2022, called p2. Each article is structured with the following fields:

- **Title**: The title of the article.
- **Description**: A brief description of the article.
- **PubDate**: The publication date of the article.
- **Source**: The name of the journal where the article is published.
- **Category**: The category or topic of the article.
- **Fullgeo**: Information about the region of article release.
